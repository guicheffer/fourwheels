## Techs

## Instalation Wordpress
Activated theme: "Four Wheels";

Just hit "make clone-configs" on terminal :) and set your wordpress up such as database.db at root path. If you have any difficulties just lemme know emailing me on: hi@guicheffer.me

## Instalation (front-end part)

This uses [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp "Gulp's Github"); So, We strongly recommend you to open a new tab in your pref. terminal typing it below to activate gulp (awesome task runner for web static files)...

Just add this stretch of code in your terminal to get the dependencies after downloading and setting up the repository as your local remote work space:

```
|sudo| npm install
```

For serving gulp files (examples are right down after bash eg):
```bash
gulp serve |--dev|
```

## Make
- uploads: get all uploads from guiatech's server if needed;
- clone-configs: get 'four wheels' working fine once you set it up;
